KPIs:
1. Capacity utilization (actual output/ optimal output, need data for optimal machine output for shortlisted products.)
2. OEE for the most used machine (need plaaned production hours, lost time, ideal cycle time(for 1 unit of procduct), ideal total time/total        					    time)
3. Stockout rate (need data for no. of days an item is out of stock.)
4. Order lead time (time btw placing an order and recieving the product.)


Advanced inventory analysis:
1. Safety stock analysis (need data for lead time, Safety stock = z-score*square root of ((average demand * lead time variability) + 					 (average lead time * demand variability)^2), z-score:customer satisfaction)
2. Reorder point (Reorder point = (Average daily demand * Lead time) + Safety stock level)
3. Stockout analysis (optional)
